# Webtography

Scrapes a website via Wget.

1. Get a GitHub token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new). Only the _public_repo_ is needed.
2. `curl --data "username=yourusername&token=yoursecrettoken&url=http://www.webcom.dk/" https://webtography.herokuapp.com/`
3. Soon after you'll see that site mirrored in a new repository on your GitHub account.
